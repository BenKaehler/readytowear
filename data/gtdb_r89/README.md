# GTDB: Genome Taxonomy Database taxonomic weights

For more information about GTDB, see https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/

**Warning: files in this directory are experimental. Many of the full-length reference sequences obtained from GTDB appear to be in mixed orientations, which currently are not handled well by q2-feature-classifier and may yield misleading results. The 515Fâ€“806R specific sequences however are likely all in the right orientation as the region extraction step we use does try to correct these. However, this has not been thoroughly tested yet, so use at your own risk.**
